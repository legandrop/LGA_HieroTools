These tools were developed for my own post-production pipeline in Hiero / Nuke Studio.
Some of them can be useful right away in other environments; others require adapting naming conventions, track structure, production integration, or internal services.
I am sharing this repository both for the reusable tools and as a reference implementation for panel-driven workflows inside Hiero / Nuke Studio.

## Installation

- Copy the contents of this folder into your `.nuke/Python/Startup` directory.
- Restart Hiero / Nuke Studio.
- If you are adapting the tools to your own environment, review any pipeline-specific integrations first, especially:
  - Flow Production Tracking / ShotGrid
  - Wasabi / S3 access
  - PipeSync-related paths and data
  - Studio-specific clip naming conventions
  - Track names such as `_comp_`, `_roto_`, `_cleanup_`, `_compRev_`, `EditRef`, `aPlate`, and `BurnIn`
  - Track naming logic documented in [docs/Docu_Logica_Nombres_Tracks.md](/Users/leg4/.nuke/Python/Startup/docs/Docu_Logica_Nombres_Tracks.md)

## User Settings

Some Hiero Tools settings are stored outside the repository so user preferences survive updates.

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\leg4-pc\AppData\Roaming\LGA\HieroTools\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/LGA/HieroTools/`
- **Fallback:** `~/.config/LGA/HieroTools/`

Current persisted settings:

- `CreateV000.ini`: stores the `Create v000` handle value.

## Reusability

- **Broadly reusable:** several tools in `ViewerTL`, parts of `Edit`, parts of `Review`, and `ClipColor`
- **Reusable with adaptation:** `Projects`, some `Flow` utilities, and some comparison / reconnect tools
- **Strongly pipeline-specific:** most of `Flow`, `Assignee`, and `Coordination`, plus anything tied to Flow Production Tracking, Wasabi, PipeSync, or studio naming rules

## Pipeline-Specific Notes

This repository is not a generic plug-and-play product. Many tools assume:

- a specific shot naming scheme
- specific timeline track names
- Flow Production Tracking / ShotGrid connectivity
- Wasabi / S3 policy workflows
- PipeSync-based local database and path conventions
- internal project layouts used in my studio

If you are adapting this pack to your own pipeline, the most reusable approach is usually:

- keep the panel structure
- keep the UI / tooltip organization
- replace the external scripts behind each button
- adapt naming utilities and track filters to your own conventions

## Why Share It

Even when a panel is tightly tied to a studio workflow, it can still be useful as:

- a reference for building custom Qt panels inside Hiero / Nuke Studio
- an example of button-driven production tools
- a template for connecting timeline actions to external scripts
- a starting point for designing a studio-specific review or production toolkit
